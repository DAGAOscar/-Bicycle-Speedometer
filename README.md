With the right components, two elements played the main role: price and size. 
Since high accuracy in detecting the intensity of the magnetic field is not necessary for the project, 
and in practice it is only necessary to detect it, it was possible to use cheaper systems. However, the bicycle counter should 
be as small as possible, which became another factor influencing the selection of individual elements of the system. Using the sensor
as another module connected to the microcontroller was also to facilitate its correct positioning relative to the magnet.
